/* void meancalc()
 *
 * Routine computes a mean or weighted mean of the planes
 *  pointed to by data and returns this value
 *  (multiplied by rescale) at the
 *  corresponding locations pointed to by mean.
 *
 * If strictness>0, the mean at a point will be
 *  defined as zero if any of the planes are zero at
 *  that point.
 *
 * If strictness==0, any plane with a zero value at
 *  a point will be excluded when computing the mean
 *  at that point.
 *
 * If strictness<0, the true mean of all studies (even if zero)
 *   will be computed.
 *
 * If the hottest pixel on the plane exceeds the value stored
 *  at max, max is reset to this new hottest value
 *
 * Scaling is now applied invariably. If weighting==0, the
 *  scaling factors are viewed as multiplicative scaing factors
 *  but if weighting!=0, the scaling factors are viewed as
 *  weights in a weighted average. In the former case, the
 *  mean is calculated by dividing by the number of acceptable
 *  datapoints (where acceptable may be modified base on
 *  strictness). In the latter case, the mean is calculated
 *  by dividing by the sum of the weightings. The combination
 *  weighting!=0, strictness==0 is not allowed (11/1/94)
 *
 * In the interest of improved quantitation, values are now
 *  rounded off rather than truncated (11/1/94)
